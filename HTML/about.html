            <h2>About Lounge Seminar</h2>

            <p>Lounge Seminar (est. 2022) is a student-led initiative aimed at fostering the 
                exchange of ideas and knowledge between students, alumni, and faculty.</p>

            <p>We organize frequent meetings - open to all students and interested persons - 
                where eager students (undergraduate/graduate) make presentations on topics 
                they're interested in and would like to share with their peers. Other invited
                guest speakers consist of SAMPS Professors and alumni who can showcase their own
                research topics, life path and choices that led them throughout their career.
            </p>

            <p>Our shared goal is to provide a welcoming environment where students 
                can grow, connect with experts in their fields of interest, engage 
                with peers, and interact with academic and 
                research staff in Mathematics and Physics — all within a relaxed and 
                friendly atmosphere (with snacks, of course, for the loungeness!).
            </p>
