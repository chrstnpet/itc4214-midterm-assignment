                <p>Lounge Seminar (est. 2022) is a student-led initiative aimed at fostering the 
                    exchange of ideas and knowledge between students, alumni, and faculty.</p>

                <p>We organize frequent meetings - open to all students and interested persons - 
                    where eager students (undergraduate/graduate) make presentations on topics 
                    they're interested in and would like to share with their peers. Other invited
                    guest speakers consist of SAMPS Professors and alumni who can showcase their own
                    research topics, life path and choices that led them throughout their career.
                </p>

                <p>Our shared goal is to provide a welcoming environment where students 
                    can grow, connect with experts in their fields of interest, engage 
                    with peers, and interact with academic and 
                    research staff in Mathematics and Physics — all within a relaxed and 
                    friendly atmosphere (with snacks, of course, for the loungeness!).
                </p>

                                        How did they get to where they are now? What choices
                                        did they make in life? How can I follow their path?

                                <p>Aggelina is a SAMPS undergraduate, passionate about linear algebra, particularly matrix theory.
                                    Despite being the newest addition to the team, she has already taken the lead in promoting our 
                                    initiative at large events - such as the 1<sup>st</sup> year students’ welcoming at SAMPS - 
                                    and greeting guests with her opening remarks at our most recent gatherings. Her youthful energy 
                                    and eagerness to learn bring a lively motivation that drives the team forward and fosters our growth.
